# Duskfall (Legacy)
*Also known as FantasyMMO*

This is Duskfall, the first iteration of my Spigot MMORPG. This version is mostly feature complete, but is currently being rewritten with an extensible, data-driven design in mind at the new repo [here](https://github.com/TomasBorsje/Duskfall).

There are still interesting things to look at, though! I recommend starting with the /registries package to see how the plugin handles entities, items, etc. You'll notice that this design is not very maintainable, hence the rewrite. The rest of the plugin content is sorted into their respective packages.

### Features
- Custom items, weapons, armour that provide different stats
- Quests
- Fake player NPCs
- Custom mob AI
- Crafting
- Backend database for player data storage
- Boss-bar compass
- Player ranks
- Custom commands
